# 5 - Scheduling

1. **What is the diference between preemptive and non-preemptive (cooperative scheduling)?**
<br>
Preemptive scheduling allows a process to be interrupted in the midst of its execution, taking the CPU away and allocating it to another process. Nonpreemptive scheduling ensures that a process relinquishes control of the CPU only when it finishes with its current CPU burst.
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. **Compare the waiting time, turnaround time, and response time scheduling criteria.**
<br>
  1. **Waiting Time**: Amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue.
  2. **Turnaround Time**: Amount of time to execute a particular process (includes waiting time in memory, and ready queue, executing in CPU, and doing IO).
  3. **Response Time**: Amount of time from when a request has been submitted until the first response is produced.
