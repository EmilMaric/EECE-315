# 10 - File System Interface

1. **Explain the two distinct parts that a file system consists of.**

    * a collection of files
    * a directory structure
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. **The concept of a file is quite general. State three file definitions.**

    * represents programs and data
    * from users perspective, the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage
    * a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. **The operating system keeps a number of attributes for each file. Which attribute is the non-human-readable name for a file?

    Indentifier
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. **A file is an abstract data type. State a number of operations that are performed on files.**

    * creating a file
    * reading a file
    * writing to a file
    * deleting a file
    * truncating a file
    * repositioning file pointer
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. **Explain the different approaches an OS can have for opening a file. What is the open-file table?**

    Files are usually opened through the `open()` system call. Some systems implicitly open a file when the first reference is made to it. The open file table is a table maintained by the OS that contains information about all open files.
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. **What is the purpose for using file locks?**

    Allows one process to lock a file and prevent other processes from gaining access to it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. **How does UNIX roughly indicate the type of a file? Compare this method with Windows.**

    * **UNIX** : a crude magic number stored at the beginning of files
    * **Windows** : type extension included at the end of a file
<br>
<br>
<br>
8. **Explain the disk structure for storing files. What is a directory?**

    Files are stored on random-access storage devices, such as hard disks, optical disks, and solid-state disks. A directory can be viewed as a symbol table that translates file names into their directory entries.
<br>
<br>
<br>
9. **Explain the following concepts:**

    1. **Tree-structured directories** - A directory tree of arbitrary height
    2. **Mount Point** - The location where an unmounted file system is mounted to; typically an empty directory.
    3. **File protection in UNIX** - We ensure file reliability by creating duplicate copies of files and we ensure protection by limiting the types of file accesses that can be made by different types of users.
